    <h2>Trend of Job Vacancies from Nov 2009 to Aug 2024</h2>

        <p>
            The line graph shows the trend in job vacancies across Australia from November 2009 to August 2024. Initially, from 2009 to 2012, there was a steady rise in job vacancies, 
            indicating recovery after the global financial crisis. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            From 2012 to 2014, the trend flattened, reflecting a period of economic adjustment. This was followed by consistent growth between 2015 and 2019, signaling a robust job market and economic expansion. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evident in a sharp decline around early 2020, but a strong recovery began later that year, peaking in late 2022. 
            However, from early 2023 onwards, job vacancies have been declining, suggesting possible economic challenges or shifts in the job market.
