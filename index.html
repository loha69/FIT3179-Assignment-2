        <p>
            From <b>November 2009 to November 2019</b>, job vacancies in Australia showed <span class = "green_text"><b>a steady upward trend</b></span>, growing from <b><span class = "red_text">148,900</span></b> to <b><span class = "green_text">230,500</span></b>. 
            This period <span class = "green_text"><b>reflects a stable and gradually improving labor market</b></span>, likely driven by consistent economic growth. However, <b>in 
            early 2020</b>, <b>the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic</b> caused <b><span class = "red_text">a sharp decline in job vacancies</span></b>, dropping to <b><span class = "red_text">128,400 in May 2020</span></b> from 
            227,400 in February 2020. The pandemic significantly disrupted the labor market, with many businesses reducing hiring or shutting 
            down altogether.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Following this dip, <b><span class = "green_text">there was a rapid recovery</span></b>, with job vacancies peaking at <b><span class = "green_text">473,100 in May 2022</span></b>. This surge <span class = "green_text"><b>reflected strong 
            demand for labor</span></b> as businesses resumed activities, often to meet post-pandemic demand or compensate for previous disruptions. 
            Interestingly, <b>from late 2022 onward</b>, <b><span class = "red_text">job vacancies began to decline gradually</span></b>, reaching <b><span class = "green_text">329,900 in August 2024</span></b>. This recent trend may 
            <b>indicate a normalization of the labor market</b>, with hiring levels adjusting after the peaks of 2021-2022. <b>Despite the decline</b>, the 
            current figures <b><span class = "green_text">still reflect a stronger job market compared to pre-pandemic levels</b></span>.

    <h2>Tracking Job Vacancies Across Australian States: Aug 2019 - Aug 2024</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Job vacancies</b>, during this period, <b>across Australian states and territories</b> remained<b><span class = "green_text"> relatively stable, 
                with New South Wales and Victoria consistently leading in the number of vacancies</span></b>. However, the onset of the COVID-19 
                pandemic in early 2020 led to a significant drop, with <b><span class = "red_text"> South Wales vacancies plummeting from 79,300 in February 2020 
                to 39,800</span> by May 2020</b>, and <b><span class = "red_text">similar trends seen across other states</span></b>. This dramatic decline was a result of widespread 
                lockdowns and economic disruptions, causing a sharp contraction in the job market.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b><span class = "green_text">recovery phase</span></b> began by <b>August 2020</b>, as job vacancies started rebounding. By <b>May 2021</b>, the figures had <b><span class = "green_text">surged</span></b>, with 
                <b><span class = "green_text">New South Wales reaching 112,800 and Victoria at 87,600</span></b>, reflecting an economy regaining strength. <b>Throughout 2022</b>, 
                job vacancies continued to climb, <b><span class = "green_text">peaking around mid-2022</span></b>, likely due to strong economic activity and pent-up demand after 
                prolonged restrictions. However, from late 2022 onwards, <b><span class = "red_text">a gradual decline set in</span></b>, as reflected by reduced figures in 2023 
                and 2024. For instance, by August 2024, <b><span class = "red_text">New South Wales had decreased to 101,400</span></b>, signaling a possible normalization after 
                earlier peaks. This recent trend <b>suggests stabilization in hiring</b>, with vacancies adjusting as businesses balance 
                post-pandemic recovery with more cautious growth strategies.

    <h2>Tracking Job Vacancies Across Industries</h2>
    <div id = "combine_chart"></div>
    <div class = "additional-text">
        <p>
            The data highlights <b>how job vacancies across various industries in Australia have changed compared to 
            pre-COVID-19 levels</b>. Some sectors experienced <b><span class = "green_text">significant growth</span></b>, such as <b><span class = "green_text">Arts and Recreation Services (up 158.1%), 
            Accommodation and Food Services (up 114.9%), and Health Care and Social Assistance (up 104.6%)</span></b>. This suggests <b>a 
            strong rebound in sectors that were heavily impacted by the pandemic</b>, particularly those reliant on public interaction 
            and essential services. However, some industries like <b><span class ="red_text">Administrative and Support Services (-18.5%) and Financial and Insurance 
            Services (-7.2%) saw declines</span></b>, indicating a slower recovery or a shift in market demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of <b>2024</b>, <b>Health Care and Social Assistance leads in job vacancies</b>, making up <b><span class = "green_text">18.3% of the total</span></b>, reflecting the
            continued demand for healthcare services. Other <b><span class = "green_text">prominent sectors</span></b> include <b><span class = "green_text">Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services 
            (11.7%) and Accommodation and Food Services (9.5%)</span></b>. This distribution <b>showcases the ongoing demand in critical and 
            service-oriented industries</b>, as well as <b>a notable presence in fields that support economic infrastructure and daily life needs</b>.
